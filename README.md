## Description ðŸŒŒ

All The Social is a brand new social network that uses a MongoDB database. The routing was written using Express.js and I also used the Mongoose ODM.

When working on this project I learned even more about writing routes, as they relate to controllers. This was definitely not my strong suit before this project, but now I feel relatively comfortable.

## Installation ðŸš€
